# MoonDeploy

*Lightweight software deployment*


## For software users


### Introduction

MoonDeploy is a cross-platform utility, written in Go, that:

1. Starts any GUI application having an associated **.moondeploy** descriptor

2. Transparently and consistently organizes (by website) such applications in a centralized, per-user directory (called *app gallery*)

3. Automatically checks for updates

4. Is especially suitable for open source applications hosted on GitHub

5. Requires minimal packaging effort - just a JSON descriptor

There are already similar solutions (for example Java Web Start, Getdown or Zero Install), but MoonDeploy is designed to make both deployment and installation definitely minimalist and simple, as well as GitHub-aware.


### Installation

MoonDeploy can be easily installed:

* on Windows, download the *setup.exe* program from the [download area](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/releases/latest) and run it

* on Linux, download the zip file from the [download area](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/releases/latest), then tell your desktop environment that you wish to employ MoonDeploy's executable to open **.moondeploy** files

* Mac OS is not officially supported, but you might want to build MoonDeploy from the Go source code - and it will probably work. You should download and uncompress MoonDeploy's source files, then run **gradle build** from within its root directory, installing dependencies as required by the build process.


### Usage

* While consulting a web page in the browser, download an **App.moondeploy** file and open it with MoonDeploy - then follow the instructions

* Broadly speaking, MoonDeploy can open any file having **.moondeploy** extension, wherever it is in the file system, starting the related app

* On Windows, there are 2 variants of the program:

  * **moondeployw** opens application without providing a command line. It is the default.

  * **moondeploy** keeps a terminal open behind your application's window - very handy for looking at MoonDeploy's log messages when  *moondeployw* has silently failed, as well as for consulting the application's text output.

* By default, the app gallery is located under **MoonDeploy_Dir**/**apps** (on Windows, in particular, the default gallery directory is **C:\MoonDeploy\apps**)


## For software creators

### Introduction

Software deployment is a very general, platform-specific activity: from simple zip files to download up to vast app stores, each solution has both benefits and disadvantages to balance.

Existing solutions such as [Java Web Start](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javawebstart/index.html), [Getdown](https://github.com/threerings/getdown/) and [Zero Install](http://0install.net/) are brilliant ways of installing applications from the web browser (and not only) to the user's directory - each technology focusing on specific aspects.

*MoonDeploy* is designed to be a lightweight, minimalist deployment tool automating downloads and updates of zip packages containing GUI application components; moreover, it provides a centralized, per-user directory called *App gallery*, where all the apps installed via MoonDeploy reside.


### Principles

* **Minimalism**: no need for creating XML files or for using a dedicated package builder; no need for certificates and signatures: just write a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) file named *App.moondeploy* and deploy it along with the zip files making up your application - for example, the zip files created by Gradle's *application* plugin. Of course, having no certificates implies that HTTPS is strongly suggested to achieve better security.

* **Technology independence**: MoonDeploy is written in Go, so it is deployed as a *native executable* on every supported operating system - it reads an application descriptor, applies its update algorithm and runs the application - which can be written in any language!

* **GitHub-friendly**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a brilliant platform for software development; applications deployed on it can easily download their latest versions, just by following a very easy naming convention for the BaseURL in their [app descriptor](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki/App-descriptors).

* **Simplicity**: installed apps reside in the *App gallery* in the user directory, organized by *host* and *base URL path*. Running an application is as easy as making MoonDeploy open a *.moondeploy* file - which can be simplified by the desktop environment. The user can see the files of an app by opening its directory in the app gallery. Likewise, uninstalling an app is achieved by deleting its directory.

* **Extensibility**: MoonDeploy is also *a Go library* which you can use to create a custom installer - not necessarily tied to the centralized app gallery; for example, you might want to create a more intriguing, app-specific loader

* **Granular versioning**: applications are versioned, but versioning can be applied to one or more of their packages as well - in order to download only the required application components

* **HTTP file server**: by running **moondeploy serve {port} {dir}**, MoonDeploy will start an HTTP server, listening on the given port and serving files from the given directory. This enables easy testing of new applications.

  A client can stop it by accessing its **/moondeploy.quit** path.

* **Logging**: MoonDeploy logs almost everything to console and to the loading dialog - in order to keep the user informed.

### Packaging

* To deploy an application, you don't even need MoonDeploy - just open a text editor to create an [app descriptor](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki/App-descriptors) in JSON format

* To install the Go library for *very* customized installers, run:
 ```
 go get github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy
 go install github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy
 ```


### Documentation


* The most important documents are in the [user-friendly wiki](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki)

* MoonDeploy's Go API has a [dedicated GoDoc page](https://godoc.org/github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy), if you wish to employ its engine for a custom installer
