# MoonDeploy

*Lightweight software deployment*

## For software users


### Introduction

MoonDeploy is a cross-platform utility, written in Go, that:

1. Starts any application having an associated **.moondeploy** descriptor

2. Transparently and consistently organizes (by website) such applications in a centralized, per-user directory (called *app gallery*) - by default, such directory is **USER_DIRECTORY/MoonDeploy**

3. Automatically checks for updates and installs them

4. Is especially suitable for open source applications hosted on GitHub

There are already similar solutions (for example Java Web Start, Getdown or Zero Install), but MoonDeploy is designed to make both deployment and installation definitely minimalist and simple, as well as GitHub-aware.


### Requirements

MoonDeploy requires a **64-bit** system. In particular, to correctly start applications from your web browser, it is recommended that you use the **64-bit version of your favorite browser**, which should be free to download from the browser's website.


### Installation

MoonDeploy can be easily installed:

* on Windows, download *MoonDeploy-windows.exe* from the [download area](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/releases/latest) and run it

* on Linux, download *MoonDeploy-linux.zip* from the [download area](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/releases/latest), extract it and run the **setup.sh** script

* Mac OS X is now supported - but the launcher is based on the Bash shell, not on GTK+. Furthermore, you should associate the *moondeploy* program with files having *.moondeploy* extension. If you are an experienced user, you can try to add the GTK+ user interface to your Mac OS version, too: please, consult [the build wiki page](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki/Building-MoonDeploy).


### Usage

* While consulting a web page in the browser, download a **.moondeploy** file and open it with MoonDeploy - for example, by double-clicking it

* By default, the app gallery, which contains all the installed apps, is **USER_DIRECTORY/MoonDeploy/apps**

* Whenever an application is run, MoonDeploy stores a dedicated log within the logs directory. By default, it is **USER_DIRECTORY/MoonDeploy/logs**

* To uninstall an application, just delete its directory


## For software developers

### Introduction

Software deployment is a very general, platform-specific activity: from simple zip files ready for download up to vast app stores, each solution has both benefits and disadvantages to balance.

Existing solutions such as [Java Web Start](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javawebstart/index.html), [Getdown](https://github.com/threerings/getdown/) and [Zero Install](http://0install.net/) are brilliant ways of installing applications from the web browser (and not only) to the user's directory - each technology focusing on specific aspects.

*MoonDeploy* is designed to be a lightweight, minimalist deployment tool automating downloads and updates of zip packages containing GUI application components; moreover, it provides a centralized, per-user directory called *App gallery*, where all the apps installed via MoonDeploy reside.


### Principles

* **Minimalism**: no need for creating XML files or for using a dedicated package builder; no need for certificates and signatures: just write a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) file having extension *.moondeploy* (usually, **App.moondeploy**) and deploy it along with the zip files making up your application - for example, the zip files created by Gradle's *application* plugin. Of course, using no certificates implies that HTTPS is strongly suggested to achieve better security.

* **Technology independence**: MoonDeploy is written in **Go**, so it is deployed as a *native executable* on every supported operating system - it reads an application descriptor, applies its update algorithm and runs the application - which can be written in any language!

* **GitHub-friendly**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a brilliant platform for software development; applications deployed on GitHub can easily download their latest versions, just by following a very easy naming convention for the BaseURL in their [app descriptor](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki/App-descriptor:-Version-3).

* **Simplicity**: installed apps reside in the *App gallery* in the user directory, organized by *host* and *base URL path*. Running an application is as easy as making MoonDeploy open a *.moondeploy* file - which can be simplified by the desktop environment. The user can see the files that compose an app by opening its directory in the app gallery. Likewise, uninstalling an app is achieved by deleting the related directory.

* **Extensibility**: MoonDeploy is also *a Go library* which you can use to create a custom installer - not necessarily tied to the centralized app gallery; for example, you might want to create a more intriguing, app-specific loader

* **Granular versioning**: applications are versioned, but versioning can be applied to one or more of their packages as well - in order to download only the required application components

* **HTTP file server**: by running **moondeploy serve {port} {dir}**, MoonDeploy will start an HTTP server, listening on the given port and serving files from the given directory. This enables easy testing of new applications.

  A client can stop it by accessing its **/moondeploy.quit** path.

* **Logging**: MoonDeploy logs almost everything to file, in great detail


### Packaging

* To deploy an application, you don't even need MoonDeploy - just open a text editor to create an [app descriptor](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki/App-descriptor:-Version-3) in JSON format.

* A few satellite projects deal with automating this process - in particular:

  * [MoonDeploy-Gradle](https://github.com/giancosta86/MoonDeploy-Gradle): a Gradle plugin that makes even simpler the creation of application descriptors

  * [MoonDeploy-Ant](https://github.com/giancosta86/MoonDeploy-Ant): a set of Ant tasks mainly dedicated to developing a custom solution based on MoonDeploy and Ant


* To install the Go library for *very* customized installers, run:
 ```
 go get github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy
 go install github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy
 ```

 then refer to the GoDoc page cited below.


### Documentation


* The most important documents are in the [user-friendly wiki](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki)

* MoonDeploy's Go API has a [dedicated GoDoc page](https://godoc.org/github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy), if you wish to employ its engine for a custom installer
