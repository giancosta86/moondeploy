Greetings, and welcome to MoonDeploy!

I'm Gianluca Costa, and I'll briefly introduce this tool for easily installing and updating applications.

This video regards the Windows operating system, but the core concepts are equally applicable to Linux and Mac OS X.

First of all, let's point our web browser – for example, Firefox – to the displayed address.

This is the official website - very minimalist: if you wish to consult the user's manual or the technical specifications, please visit its GitHub page, especially its wiki.

To download MoonDeploy, let's click the "Get MoonDeploy" button: it will download the installation bundle crafted for your operating system - in this case, a traditional Windows setup wizard!

Let's download and execute it: the wizard should be run by a system administrator, as it will install MoonDeploy for every user in the system.

Let's choose "Yes" to start the installation...

Apart from this detail, the setup procedure is straightforward and can be completed by always clicking "Next". Let's wait for the files to be copied... and let's click "Finish".

Voilà! Our system is now ready to run new applications using MoonDeploy.

But... how can we actually install applications? As a starting point, we need to open files having ".moondeploy" extension, that are called "app descriptors". Usually, you'll find them on web pages, but they can also be shared via e-mail, social networks, instant messaging - because they are small text files.

Let's run our very first application - as an example, we'll choose GraphsJ, which is a ScalaFX didactic application dedicated to graph problems.

To install GraphsJ, we need its app descriptor - which, in this case, can be downloded from its website!

Let's browse to this other address.

In the upper part of the page, there are 2 buttons:

* "Get binary zip" is for users not having MoonDeploy - they can run the app by downloading and extracting the zip file, as usual: the problem is that they will have to manually organize their downloaded applications and keep them up-to-date – tasks which would be automatically performed by MoonDeploy.

* "Run with MoonDeploy" is just what we need: let's click on it to download the app descriptor for GraphsJ

Firefox shows this dialog box - let's choose "Open with: MoonDeploy Application", and MoonDeploy will start executing the app!

When you run any app for the first time, MoonDeploy will show you a few details about it - its title, its publisher and, most important, the website which will provide the application files. It is up to you to check that you trust such address; equally important, the address should employ HTTPS, for enhanced security - otherwise, MoonDeploy will issue a warning.

Let's accept, and MoonDeploy starts downloading the app files, because it's the first run; the next executions will employ the downloaded packages - unless a new version of the specific app is available.

In the end - MoonDeploy will ask you to create a shortcut for the application on your Desktop - which is usually a good idea, so let's accept.

Finally, our program runs. And here we are! We have installed an app and run it, without manually downloading and extracting its zip files, and without locating its binary files.

But there is more! Let's close the application; how can we run it again? And what happens?

To start GraphsJ again, we can double click its desktop shortcut - otherwise, we'd need to double click its local descriptor on your PC, or use an app manager, which we'll mention in a while.

When we start an installed app via MoonDeploy, it will usually check for updates - connecting to its own website: if a new version is available, MoonDeploy will install and run it; otherwise, the current version is started: this is one more advantage of MoonDeploy over manual downloading of zip files.

There's little else to say about installing and running applications – so, let's end the video with an interesting app that completes MoonDeploy: it's called MaanBloem and it enables you to intuitively run, inspect and uninstall all the applications which you have installed via MoonDeploy.

Let's point our browser to this final address and let's click on "Run with MoonDeploy": we'll see the very same setup process as for GraphsJ.

Let's download the app files...

Now that MaanBloem is installed, let's start it... and here we are: all the applications installed via MoonDeploy - in this example, GraphsJ and MaanBloem itself - are listed in the window. If we want to run GraphsJ, we just select it and click "Run app" - and MoonDeploy will start it.

This concludes our brief introduction on MoonDeploy - I hope you have found this tecnology interesting! ^__^!

Thank you for watching! Goodbye! ^__^
